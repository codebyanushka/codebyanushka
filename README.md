Hi there 👋

I’m Anushka Tiwari, a developer in progress based in India 🇮🇳

Right now, I’m exploring a lot of things.

I’ve built one app so far, and I’m excited to build many more.

I don’t want to limit myself to just one label —

I want to build apps, websites, and whatever ideas I’m curious about next.

I’m learning by doing, breaking things, fixing them,

and slowly turning ideas into real projects 🚀

🧠 Currently Learning / Exploring

Mobile app development (Flutter)

Backend development (Django, Python)

Databases (PostgreSQL)

Web development (learning step by step)

✨ What Drives Me

Curiosity over perfection

Building over overthinking

Progress over titles

🎯 Fun Facts

🐶 I have two dogs

☕ I don’t like coffee or tea

🎧 Music is always playing

🛠 I love building things and making them better
